# A FEW THINGS TO TRY 66
# words as we want (one word per line, continuing until we just
# press Enter on an empty line) and then repeats the words back
# to us in alphabetical order. Make sure to test your program thoroughly;
# for example, does hitting Enter on an empty line always
# exit your program? Even on the first line? And the second? Hint:
# Thereâ€™s a lovely array method that will give you a sorted version of
# an array: sort. Use it!
